# Amazon-Scraper
Scrape Amazon's products details by using this scraper! :muscle:

It gathers data such as product description, price, rating, and product links. To scrape the desired product's info, simply modify the 'search_term' variable and execute the script. The scraper will generate a CSV file containing all the aforementioned details tailored to your search term (product).

The project utilizes Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing, Selenium for web automation, and Pandas for data manipulation.
